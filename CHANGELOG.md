# Documentations
Added – For any new features that have been added since the last version was released
Changed – To note any changes to the software’s existing functionality
Deprecated– To note any features that were once stable but are no longer and have thus been removed
Fixed– Any bugs or errors that have been fixed should be so noted
Removed– This notes any features that have been deleted and removed from the software
Security– This acts as an invitation to users who want to upgrade and avoid any software vulnerabilities  


Changelogs are made to be read by humans, making legibility vitally important  
It should be easy to link any section and any entry for every software version  
Each version should have 1 subsection only  
All changes that are the same should be grouped together  
Releases / new versions should be listed with newest on top (reverse chronological order)  
Each new version should have its release date displayed  
These dates should follow the ISO standard format YYYY-MM-DD / 2020-01-01  
Always mention whether or not Semantic Versioning has been used
